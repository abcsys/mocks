# Mock digis

> TBD update mocks w/ new digi library
> TBD add wip list

The repo includes digis that simulate individual devices (i.e. mocks such as a mock lamp) and contexts (i.e. scenes such as a room). Information about how to use and configure these mocks and scenes can be found in this [paper](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~silvery/hotnets22-digibox.pdf).
