# Mock digis

The repo includes digis that simulate individual devices (*i.e.* mocks such as a mock lamp) and contexts (*i.e.* scenes such as a room). Information about how to use and configure these mocks and scenes can be found in  [digibox paper](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~silvery/hotnets22-digibox.pdf).
